    <p><span class="intro">The universe expands and contracts like a great heart.</span> <br><br>It is expanding, the farthest nebulae <br>Rush with the speed of light into empty space. <br>It will contract, <br>the <span class="spread">immense navies of stars and galaxies, </span><br>dust clouds and nebulae <br>Are recalled home, they crush against each other in one harbor, <br>they stick in one lump <br>And then explode it, nothing can hold them down; <br>there is no way to express that explosion; <br>all that exists <br>Roars into flame, the tortured fragments rush away from each other into all the sky, <br>new universes <br>Jewel the black breast of night; <br>and far off the outer nebulae <br>like charging spearmen again <br>Invade emptiness. </p>

    <p><br>And our huge bombs: <br>it is a kind of homesickness perhaps <br>for the howling fireblast that we were born from. <br>But the whole sum of the energies <br>That made and contain the giant atom survives. <br><span class="bold">It will gather again and pile up, <br>the power and the glory--<br>And no doubt it will burst again; diastole and systole: </span><br>the whole universe beats like a heart. </p>

    <p>Peace in our time was never one of God's promises; <br>but back and forth, live and die, <br>burn and be damned, <br>The great heart beating, pumping into our arteries <br>His terrible life. <br>He is beautiful beyond belief. <br>And we, God's apes--or tragic children--<br>share in the beauty. <br>We see it above our torment, <br>that's what life's for. <br>He is no God of love, no justice of a little city <br>like Dante's Florence, <br>no anthropoid God Making commandments: <br>this is the God who does not care <br>and will never cease.</p>

  <div class="last">
    <p>Look at the seas there <br>Flashing against this rock in the darkness--<br>look at the tide-stream stars--<br>and the fall of nations--<br>and dawn <br>Wandering with wet white feet down the Caramel Valley <br>to meet the sea. <br>These are real and we see their beauty. <br>The great explosion is probably only a metaphor--<br>I know not--of faceless violence, <br>the root of all things.</p>
