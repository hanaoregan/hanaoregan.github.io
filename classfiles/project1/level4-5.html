      <p>The universe <strong>expands and contracts</strong> like a great heart. <br>It is expanding, <em>the farthest nebulae <br>Rush with the speed of light into empty space. <br></em>It will contract, the immense navies of stars and galaxies, <br>dust clouds and nebulae <br>Are recalled home, they crush against each other in one harbor, <br>they stick in one lump <br>And then <span class="space">explode it, nothing can hold them down; <br>there is no way to express that explosion; <br>all that exists <br></span><span class="large">Roars into flame, the tortured fragments <br>rush away from each other into all the sky, <br>new universes <br>Jewel the black breast of night; </span><br>and far off the outer nebulae like charging spearmen again <br>Invade emptiness. </p>

      <p>No wonder we are so fascinated with fireworks <br>And our huge bombs: <br>it is a kind of homesickness perhaps for the <br>howling fireblast that we were born from. <br><em>But the whole sum of the energies <br>That made and contain the giant atom survives. </em><br>It will gather again and pile up, <br><span class="large">the power and the glory--<br>And no doubt it will burst again; </span><br>diastole and systole: the whole universe <br>beats like a heart.</p>

      <p>Peace in our time was never one of God's promises; <br>but back and forth, <br>live and die, burn and be damned, The great heart beating, <br>pumping into our arteries <br><span class="large">His terrible life. <br></span>He is beautiful beyond belief. <br>And we, God's apes--or tragic children--<br>share in the beauty. <br>We see it above our torment, that's what life's for. <br>He is no God of love, no justice of a little city <br>like Dante's Florence, no anthropoid God <br>Making commandments: <em>this is the God who does not care <br>and will never cease.</em> </p>
    </div>

    <div class="p2">
      <p>Look at the seas there <br>Flashing against this rock in the darkness--<br>look at the tide-stream stars--and the fall of nations--and dawn <br>Wandering with wet white feet down the Caramel Valley to meet the sea. <br><span class="large">These are real <br>and we see their beauty.</span> <br>The great explosion is probably only a metaphor--I know not--<br>of <span class="large">faceless violence, <br><em>the root of all things.</em></span></p>
