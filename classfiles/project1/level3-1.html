    <p>The universe <strong>e&nbsp;x&nbsp;&nbsp;p&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> and <em>contracts</em> like a great heart. </p>

  <div class="p2">
    <p>It is expanding, the farthest nebulae<br>Rush with the speed of light into empty space. <br>It will contract, the immense navies of stars and galaxies, dust clouds and nebulae <br>Are recalled home, they crush against each other in one harbor, they stick in one lump <br>And then explode it, nothing can hold them down; <br>there is no way to express that explosion; all that exists <br>Roars into flame, the tortured fragments rush away from each other into all the sky, new universes <br>Jewel the black breast of night; and far off the outer nebulae <br>like charging spearmen again <br>Invade emptiness. </p>

  <h3><em>No wonder we are so fascinated with fireworks</em></h3>

  <div class="p3">
    <p>And our huge bombs: it is a kind of homesickness <br>perhaps for the howling fireblast that we were born from. <br>But the whole sum of the energies <br>That made and contain the giant atom survives. <br>It will gather again and pile up, <br>the power and the glory--<br>And no doubt it will burst again; diastole and systole: <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the whole universe beats like a heart.</p>

  <div class="p4">
    <p>Peace in our time was never one of God's promises; but back and forth, <br>live and die, burn and be damned, <br>The great heart beating, pumping into our arteries <br>His terrible life. <br><br>He is beautiful beyond belief. And we, God's apes--<br>or tragic children--share in the beauty. <br>We see it above our torment, that's what life's for. <br>He is no God of love, no justice of a little city like Dante's Florence, no anthropoid God <br>Making commandments: </p>

  <h2><em>this is the God who does not care and will never cease.</em></h2>

  <div class="p5">
    <p>Look at the seas there <br>Flashing against this rock in the darkness--look at the tide-stream stars--<br>and the fall of nations--and dawn <br>Wandering with wet white feet down the Caramel Valley to meet the sea. <br>These are real and we see their beauty. <br>The great explosion is probably only a metaphor--I know not--of faceless violence, <br>the root of all things.</p>
