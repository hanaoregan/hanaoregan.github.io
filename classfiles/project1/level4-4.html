    <p>The universe expands and contracts like a great heart. It is expanding, the farthest nebulae Rush with the speed of light into empty space. It will contract, <span class="space">the immense navies of stars and galaxies, dust clouds and nebulae Are recalled home, they crush against each other in one harbor, they stick in one lump And then</span> <span class="space2">explode it, nothing can hold them down; there is no way to express that explosion; all that exists <span id="strong"><strong>Roars into flame,</strong></span> the tortured fragments rush away from each other into all the sky, </span>new universes Jewel the black breast of night; and far off the outer nebulae like charging spearmen again Invade emptiness.</p>

  <div class="p2">
    <p>No wonder we are so fascinated with fireworks And our huge bombs: it is a kind of homesickness perhaps for the howling fireblast that we were born from. But the whole sum of the energies That made and contain the giant atom survives. <span class="space">It will gather again and pile up, the power and the glory--</span><span class="space2">And no doubt <strong>it will burst again;</strong> diastole and systole: </span>the whole universe beats</p>

    <p>Peace in our time was never one of God's promises; but back and forth, live and die, burn and be damned, The great heart beating, <span class="space">pumping into our arteries His terrible life.</span> <span class="space2">He is <strong>beautiful beyond belief.</strong> </span>And we, God's apes--or tragic children--share in the beauty. We see it above our torment, that's what life's for. He is no God of love, no justice of a little city like Dante's Florence, no anthropoid God Making commandments: this is the God who does not care and will never cease. </p>

  <div class="p3">
    <p>Look at the seas there Flashing against this rock in the darkness--look at the tide-stream stars--and the fall of nations--and dawn Wandering with wet white feet down the Caramel Valley to meet the sea. These are real and we see their beauty. <span class="space">The great explosion is probably only a metaphor--I know not--</span><span class="space2">of faceless violence, the root of all things.</span></p>
