  <p><h3>The<br> <br>u<br>n<br>i<br>v<br>e<br>r<br>s<br>e<br> <br>e<br><br>x<br><br><br>p<br><br><br><br>a<br><br><br><br><br>n<br><br><br><br><br><br>d<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>s<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> </h3><h5>and contracts like a great heart. </h5></p>
  <p><h1>It is <em>expanding</em>, the farthest nebulae</h1> Rush with the speed of light into empty space. <br>It will contract, the immense navies of stars and galaxies, dust clouds and nebulae <br>Are recalled home, they crush against each other in one harbor, they stick in one lump <br>And then explode it, <br><h4>nothing can hold them down;</h4></p>
  <p><h2>there is no way to express that explosion; all that exists <br><em>Roars</em> into flame, the tortured fragments rush away from each other into all the sky, new universes <br>Jewel the black breast of night; </h2></p>
  <p>and far off the outer nebulae like charging spearmen again <h5>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invade emptiness.</h5> No wonder we are so fascinated with fireworks <br>And our huge bombs: it is a kind of homesickness <br>perhaps for the howling fireblast that we were born from. <br>But the whole sum of the energies <br>That made and contain the giant atom survives. <h1>It will gather again and pile up, the power and the glory--And no doubt it will burst again; diastole and systole: the whole universe beats like a heart.</h1></p>
  <p>Peace in our time was never one of God's promises; but back and forth, <br>live and die, <br>burn and be damned, <br>The great heart beating, pumping into our arteries His terrible life. </p>
  <p>He is beautiful beyond belief. <br>And we, God's apes--or tragic children--share in the beauty. We see it above our torment, <br>that's what life's for. <h2>He is no God of love, no justice of a little city like Dante's Florence, no anthropoid God Making commandments: this is the God who does not care and will never cease. </h2></p>
  <p>Look at the seas there <br>Flashing against this rock in the darkness--<br>look at the tide-stream stars--<br>and the fall of nations--and dawn <br>Wandering with wet white feet down the Caramel Valley to meet the sea. <br>These are real and we see their beauty. <br>The great explosion is probably only a metaphor--I know not--of faceless violence, <h4>the<br><br> r<br>o<br>o<br>t<br><br> of all <br><br>t<br><br>h<br><br><br>i<br><br><br><br>n<br><br><br><br><br>g<br><br><br><br><br><br>s<br><br><br>.</h4></p>
