    <p><em>The universe expands and contracts like a great heart.</em> It is expanding, the farthest nebulae Rush with the speed of light into empty space. It will contract, the immense navies of stars and galaxies, dust clouds and nebulae Are recalled home, <strong><em>they crush against each other in one harbor, they stick in one lump And then explode it, nothing can hold them down; there is no way to express that explosion; all that exists Roars into flame, the tortured fragments rush away from each other into all the sky, new universes Jewel the black breast of night;</em></strong> and far off the outer nebulae like charging spearmen again <br><br>Invade <br><br><br>emptiness.</p>

    <p>No wonder we are so fascinated with fireworks And our huge bombs: it is a kind of homesickness perhaps <em>for the howling fireblast that we were born from. </em>But the whole sum of the energies That made and contain the giant atom survives. <em><strong>It will gather again and pile up, the power and the glory--And no doubt it will burst again; diastole and systole: </strong></em>the whole universe beats like<br><br> a<br><br><br> heart. </p>

  <div>
    <p>Peace in our time was never one of God's promises; but back and forth, live and die, burn and be damned, The great heart beating, pumping into our arteries <strong><em>His terrible life.</em></strong> He is beautiful beyond belief. And we, God's apes--or tragic children--share in the beauty. We see it above our torment, that's what life's for. He is no God of love, no justice of a little city like Dante's Florence, no anthropoid God Making commandments: this is the God who does not care and will <br><br>never <br><br><br>cease. </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>Look at the seas there Flashing against this rock in the darkness--look at the tide-stream stars--and the fall of nations--and dawn Wandering with wet white feet down the Caramel Valley to meet the sea. These are real and we see their beauty. The great explosion is probably only a metaphor--I know not--of faceless violence, <br>the root of <br><br>all <br><br><br>things.</p>
