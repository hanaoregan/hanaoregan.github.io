    <p><strong>The universe expands and contracts like a great heart.</strong> <br>It is expanding, the farthest nebulae <br>Rush with the speed of light into empty space. <br>It will contract, the immense navies of stars and galaxies, dust clouds and nebulae <br>Are recalled home, they crush against each other in one harbor, they stick in one lump <br>And then explode it, nothing can hold them down; <br>there is no way to express that explosion; all that exists <br>Roars into flame, the tortured fragments rush away from each other into all the sky, new universes <br>Jewel the black breast of night; <br>and far off the outer nebulae like charging spearmen again <br>Invade emptiness. </p>
    <p><strong>No wonder we are so fascinated with fireworks <br>And our huge bombs:<br></strong> it is a kind of homesickness perhaps for the howling fireblast that we were born from. <br>But the whole sum of the energies <br>That made and contain the giant atom survives. <br>It will gather again and pile up, <br>the power and the glory--<br>And no doubt it will burst again; diastole and systole: <br>the whole universe beats like a heart. </p>
    <p><strong>Peace in our time was never one of God's promises;</strong> <br>but back and forth, <br>live and die, burn and be damned, <br>The great heart beating, pumping into our arteries <br>His terrible life. <br>He is beautiful beyond belief. <br>And we, God's apes--<br>or tragic children--share in the beauty. <br>We see it above our torment, that's what life's for. <br>He is no God of love, no justice of a little city <br>like Dante's Florence, no anthropoid God <br>Making commandments: <br>this is the God who does not care and <br>will never cease. </p>
    <p><strong>Look at the seas there <br>Flashing against this rock in the darkness--</strong>look at the tide-stream stars--<br>and the fall of nations--<br>and dawn <br>Wandering with wet white feet down the Caramel Valley <br>to meet the sea. <br>These are real and we see their beauty. <br>The great explosion is probably only a metaphor--<br>I know not--<br>of faceless violence, <br>the root of all things.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
