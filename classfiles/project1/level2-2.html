    <p><em>The universe expands and contracts like a great heart.</em> <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is expanding, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the farthest nebulae</p>
    <p><em>Rush with the speed of light into empty space.</em> It will contract, the <h1>i&nbsp;m&nbsp;m&nbsp;e&nbsp;n&nbsp;s&nbsp;e</h1> navies of </p>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>stars and galaxies,</li>
        <li>dust clouds and nebulae</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Are recalled home, <em>they crush against each other in one harbor, they stick in one lump</em> <br><br><strong>And then explode it, <br>nothing can hold them down;</strong> there is no way to express that explosion; </p>
    <p>all that exists </p>
    <p><h2>Roars into flame, the <em>tortured</em> fragments rush away from each other into all <a href="http://www.space.com/skywatching"/>the sky,</a></h2> new universes <br>Jewel the black breast of night; <br>and far off the outer nebulae <em>like charging spearmen again</em></p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Invade &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;emptiness. </p>
    <p><h5>No wonder we are so fascinated with fireworks <br>And our huge bombs:</h5> it is a kind of homesickness perhaps <br><h3>for the howling <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQwAZQP6rr8"/>fireblast</a> </h3>that we were born from. <br>But the whole sum of the energies <br>That made and contain the giant atom survives. <br>It will </p>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li>gather again</li>
        <li>and pile up,</li>
        <li>the power and the glory--</li>
        <li>And no doubt it will burst again; </li>
        <li>diastole and systole:</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>the whole universe beats like a heart. <br>Peace in our time was never one of God's promises; but <strong>back and forth,</strong> <em>live and die,</em> burn and be damned, <br>The great heart beating, pumping into our arteries <h2>His terrible life.</h2> He is beautiful beyond belief. And we, God's apes--or tragic children--share in the beauty. We see it above our torment, that's what life's for. <em>He is no God of love, no justice of a little city like Dante's Florence, no anthropoid God Making commandments:</em> this is the God who does not care and will never cease. Look at the seas there Flashing against this rock in the darkness--look at the tide-stream stars--and the fall of nations--and dawn Wandering with wet white feet down the Caramel Valley to meet the sea. <br>These are real and we see their beauty. </p>
    <p><h4>The great explosion is probably only a metaphor--I know not--of faceless violence, the root of all things.</h4>
