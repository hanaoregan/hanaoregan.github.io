    <p class="p1">The universe expands and contracts like a great heart. <br>It is expanding, the farthest nebulae <br>Rush with the speed of light into empty space. <br>It will contract, the immense navies of stars and galaxies, dust clouds and nebulae <br>Are recalled home, they crush against each other in one harbor, they stick in one lump </p>
    <p class="space">And then explode it, nothing can hold them down; <br>there is no way to express that explosion; <br>all that exists <br><strong>Roars into flame,</strong> <em>the tortured fragments rush away <br>from each other into all the sky, </em>new universes <br>Jewel the black breast of night;</p>
    <p class="p1">and far off the outer nebulae like charging spearmen again <br><br><br><strong>Invade emptiness. </strong></p>

    <p>No wonder we are so fascinated with fireworks <br>And our huge bombs: it is a kind of homesickness perhaps <br>for the howling fireblast <br>that we were born from. <br>But the whole sum of the energies <br>That made and contain the giant atom survives. <br><span class="start">It will gather again and pile up, </span><br><span class="middle">the power and the glory--</span><br><span class="end"And no doubt it will burst again; <br>diastole and systole: </span><br>the whole universe beats like a heart. </p>
  </div>

  <div class="p2">
    <p>Peace in our time was <br>never one of God's promises; <br>but back and forth, <br>live and die, burn and be damned, <br>The great heart beating, p<br>umping into our arteries <br>His terrible life. <br>He is beautiful beyond belief. <br>And we, God's apes--or tragic children--<br>share in the beauty. <br>We see it above our torment, <br>that's what life's for. <br><strong>He is no God of love, <br>no justice of a little city like <br>Dante's Florence, no anthropoid God <br>Making commandments: <br>this is the God who <br>does <br>not <br>care <br>and will never cease.</strong></p>

    <p class="p3"><br>Look at the seas there <br>Flashing against this rock in the darkness--<br>look at the tide-stream stars--<br>and the fall of nations--<br>and dawn <br>Wandering with wet white feet down the Caramel Valley <br>to meet the sea. <br>These are real and we see their beauty. <br>The great explosion is probably only a metaphor--<br>I know not--of faceless violence, <br>the root of all things.</p>
