    <p><span class="upper">The universe expands and contracts like a great heart.</span> It is expanding, the farthest nebulae Rush with the speed of light into empty space. It will contract, the immense navies of stars and galaxies, dust clouds and nebulae <strong>Are recalled home, they crush against each other in one harbor, they stick in one lump And then explode it, nothing can hold them down; there is no way to express that explosion; all that exists Roars into flame, the tortured fragments rush away from each other into all the sky, </strong>new universes Jewel the black breast of night; and far off the outer nebulae like charging spearmen again Invade emptiness. </p>

    <p>No wonder we are so fascinated with <strong>fireworks And our huge bombs: </strong>it is a kind of homesickness perhaps for the <strong>howling fireblast</strong> that we were born from. But the whole sum of the energies That made and contain the giant atom survives. It will gather again and pile up, the <strong>power and the glory</strong>--And <em>no doubt it will burst again</em>; diastole and systole: the whole universe beats like a heart. </p>

    <p>Peace in our time was never one of God's promises; but <en>back and forth, live and die, burn and be damned,</em> The great heart beating, pumping into our arteries <strong>His terrible life.</strong> He is beautiful beyond belief. And we, God's apes--or tragic children--share in the beauty. We see it above our torment, that's what life's for. He is no God of love, no justice of a little city like Dante's Florence, no anthropoid God Making commandments: this is the God who <em><strong>does not care and will never cease.</strong></em> </p>

  <div class="p4">
    <p>Look at the seas there Flashing against this rock in the <strong>darkness</strong>--look at the tide-stream stars--and the fall of nations--and dawn Wandering with wet white feet down the Caramel Valley to meet the sea. These are <em>real and we see their beauty</em>. The great explosion is probably only a metaphor--I know not--of faceless violence, <span class="upper">the root of all things.</span></p>
