        <p>The universe expands &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contracts <br>like a great heart.</p>
        <p>It&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expanding, <br><br><br><br><br><br>the farthest nebulae Rush with the speed of light into empty space. </p>
        <p>I&nbsp;&nbsp;t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; w&nbsp;&nbsp;i&nbsp;&nbsp;l&nbsp;l contract, the immense navies of stars and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;galaxies,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dust clouds and nebulae <br>Are recalled home, they crush against each other in one harbor, they stick in one lump <br>And then <br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;explode it, <br><br>nothing can hold them down; there is no way to express that explosion; all that exists <br>Roars into flame, the tortured fragments rush a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from each other into all the sky, new universes <br>Jewel the black breast of night; and far off the outer nebulae <br>like charging spearmen <br>again <br>Invade emptiness. </p>
        <p><br>No wonder we are so fascinated with fireworks <br><br>And our huge bombs: <br><br>it is a kind of homesickness perhaps for the &nbsp;&nbsp;h&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;o&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w&nbsp;&nbsp;l&nbsp;&nbsp;i&nbsp;&nbsp;n&nbsp;g fireblast that we were born from. <br>But the whole sum of the energies <br>That made and contain the giant atom survives. <br>It will gather again and pile up, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the power and the glory--And no doubt it will burst again; diastole and systole: the whole universe beats like a heart. </p>
        <p>Peace in our time was never one of God's promises; but &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;back and forth, live and die, burn and be damned, <br>The great heart beating, pumping into our arteries <br><br>His terrible life. <br>He is beautiful beyond belief. <br>And we, God's apes--or tragic children--share in the beauty. <br><br>We see it above our torment, that's what life's for. He is no God of love, no justice of a little city like Dante's Florence, no anthropoid God Making commandments: </p>
        <p>this is the God who does not care and will never cease. <br><br>Look at the seas there <br>Flashing against this rock in the darkness--look at the tide-stream stars--and the fall of nations--and dawn <br>Wandering with wet white feet down the Caramel Valley to meet the sea. <br>These are real and we see their beauty. <br>The great explosion is probably only a metaphor--I know not--of faceless violence, the root of all things.
